> #### This fork is practically no different from the original repository, it's implements automatic building (with every fetch) via GitHub Actions with minimal changes to the source code:
> - cheat-library/cheat-library.vcxproj: all CustomBuildStep's sections commented out - they run injector.exe after a successful build, thereby making the build duration infinite
>
> All changes applied to the code can be viewed in **.github/workflows/code-processing.py file.**
>
> All build steps can be viewed in **.github/workflows/msbuild.yml file.**
